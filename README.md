# reduced_getit

Implementation of the 'reduced' API for the 'GetIt' state management framework with following features:

1. Implementation of the ```ReducedStore``` interface 
2. Register a state for management.
3. Trigger a rebuild on widgets selectively after a state change.

## Features

#### 1. Implementation of the ```ReducedStore``` interface

```dart
extension ReducedValueNotifier<S> on ValueNotifier<S> {
  S getState() => value;

  void reduce(Reducer<S> reducer) {
    value = reducer(value);
  }

  ReducedStore<S> get proxy =>
      ReducedStoreProxy(getState, reduce, this);
}
```

#### 2. Register a state for management.

```dart
Object registerState<S>(S initialState) {
  final instance = ValueNotifier(initialState);
  GetIt.instance.registerSingleton(instance);
  return instance;
}
```

```dart
FutureOr unregisterState(Object instance) =>
    GetIt.instance.unregister(instance: instance);
```

#### 3. Trigger a rebuild on widgets selectively after a state change.

```dart
class ReducedConsumer<S, P> extends StatelessWidget with GetItMixin {
  ReducedConsumer({
    super.key,
    required this.transformer,
    required this.builder,
  });

  final ReducedTransformer<S, P> transformer;
  final ReducedWidgetBuilder<P> builder;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => builder(
        props: watchOnly<ValueNotifier<S>, P>(
          (ValueNotifier<S> notifier) => transformer(notifier.proxy),
        ),
      );
}
```

## Getting started

In the pubspec.yaml add dependencies on the package 'reduced' and on the package  'reduced_getit'.

```
dependencies:
  reduced: 0.2.1
  reduced_getit: 0.2.1
```

Import package 'reduced' to implement the logic.

```dart
import 'package:reduced/reduced.dart';
```

Import package 'reduced' to use the logic.

```dart
import 'package:reduced_getit/reduced_getit.dart';
```

## Usage

Implementation of the counter demo app logic with the 'reduced' API without further dependencies on state management packages.

```dart
// logic.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reduced/reduced.dart';

class Incrementer extends Reducer<int> {
  @override
  int call(int state) => state + 1;
}

class Props {
  Props({required this.counterText, required this.onPressed});
  final String counterText;
  final Callable<void> onPressed;
}

Props transformer(ReducedStore<int> store) => Props(
      counterText: '${store.state}',
      onPressed: CallableAdapter(store, Incrementer()),
    );

Widget builder({Key? key, required Props props}) => Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('reduced_getit example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(props.counterText),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: props.onPressed,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
```

Finished counter demo app using logic.dart and 'reduced_getit' package:

```dart
// main.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:reduced_getit/reduced_getit.dart';
import 'logic.dart';

void main() {
  registerState(0);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => MaterialApp(
        theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
        home: ReducedConsumer(
          transformer: transformer,
          builder: builder,
        ),
      );
}
```
